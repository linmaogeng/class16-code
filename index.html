        <h1>Swing Exercise</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The main objective of this exercise is to allow you to
            write some 'useful' Swing code.</p>


        <h2>The Project</h2>

        <p>You'll be implementing a calculator, but one with a small
            twist: it calculates in base 4 (quaternary) only. So the
            only digits are 0, 1, 2, and 3. And 2 + 2 is not 4, but 10.</p>

        <p>To keep things simple, division will be integer division
            ("decimal digits" in other bases get tricky). So in base 10,
            37 / 4 = 9, right? In quaternary, we'd write that as 211 /
            10 = 21.</p>

        <p>
            In the skeleton, I've already set you up with some buttons.
            I've also given you a skeleton of a class that will do the <em>actual</em>
            calculation. Your big task is to think through the event
            handling and calculational logic. (Note that you can never have a "purely" GUI application&mdash;there always
            has to be some "business logic," too.)
            </p>
            
            <p>Feel free to collaborate with teammates on this one. Nothing needs to be handed in for this exercise, but
            the next project might be based on this in some way.</p>
